## Development notes

1. To serve files on your machine, consider using the `SimpleHTTPServer`
   module that ships with the Python programming language. After installing
   Python you should be able to run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` inside the
   directory you'd like to "view" in the browser. Then, fire up a browser
   and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
